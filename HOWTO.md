# How ROCK PAPER SCISSORS works

* TJBot makes his decision (rock, paper, scissors) and displays it on the display, so the player knows, there is no trick.

* Then the player needs to make his decision -  that means to choose one of the objects in front of him.

* The player lets TJBot take a picture of his chosen object and
TJBot classifies it right after.

* TJBot determines the winner of the game based on his choice and pre-approved players choice.

* TJBot guides you through the game step by step, the conversation is predefined, but can be easily adjusted to your own needs.

* To create your own conversation dialogs we recommend to visit one of these free tutorials:
